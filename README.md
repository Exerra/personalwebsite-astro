# [Exerra's website](https://exerra.xyz)

This is the 3rd redesign of Exerra's website, featuring a beige, grey, black and red colour scheme. The images have been sourced from TRUFCreative.

## Project stack
The website framework is [Astro](https://astro.build), which is a static site builder that generates ridiculously small JS.

The CSS framework is TailwindCSS. It is basically CSS but in HTML classes.

Website can be deployed on any hosting provider that has support for a build step & output directory, but the master branch is hosted on Cloudflare Pages and any other branches on Vercel.
