                    Congratulations! You found an easter egg! This is a little dialogue between a mixture of me & Dagoth Ur.
                    The voice was generated using ElevenLabs AI using a few audio fragments of Dagoth Ur from The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind.

We are free, and will remain to be free, and even if we aren't, we will break free with song and dance, again. The singing revolution is, sadly, not talked about enough. The three Baltic states broke free from Russian reign not with a civil war and bloodshed, but by dancing, singing and creating the Baltic Way - a 670 kilometre human chain holding hands from Tallinn, through Riga, to Vilnius. Singing and dancing is part of our culture as well, with the song and dance festival happening every 4 years, where 43 thousand people came to sing and dance.",

			{
				question: "What is your favourite game?",
				reply: "Even though Dagoth Ur is from Morrowind, and Skyrim being the more popular game, I prefer Oblivion. There is a certain charm to it, it's quests are fun and silly, the characters are perfect and the setting is great. Even if you play just one playthrough of it, even if you're an adult, you will still feel nostalgia for Oblivion, and that is an indicator of a quality game. Morrowind has something similar, but Skyrim doesn't. Maybe that is because I have played Skyrim more than the rest of the games, but Skyrim has always felt more bland in comparison. It takes itself too seriously, and doesn't let people do a quest inside of a painting like Oblivion.",
